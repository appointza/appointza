                  12. Napz Destination Alarm (com.wakemethere)
                </h2>
                <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  <p>
                    Napz is a destination arrival-alarm application published by Appointza Technology
                    (OPC) Private Limited under the Android package name <strong>com.wakemethere</strong>.
                    The following terms describe how Napz handles location and account information.
                  </p>

                  <div>
                    <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">Location data and purpose</h3>
                    <p>
                      Napz collects and uses precise location data to determine your current location,
                      calculate your distance from a destination you select, show your position on the
                      map, save a current place when requested, and trigger your destination arrival
                      alarm when you enter the selected alert radius.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div>
                    <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">Background location</h3>
                    <p>
                      During an active trip, Napz continues collecting precise location in the
                      background, including when the app is minimized, the screen is off, or the app is
                      closed where Android allows. Background collection is used to calculate distance
                      and trigger the arrival alarm, and stops when you stop the trip or the trip ends.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div>
                    <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">
                      On-device processing and map providers
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      Continuous trip GPS used for distance checks and arrival alarms is processed on
                      your device and is not uploaded to Napz servers. When you use map, place-search,
                      or place-name features, Napz may transmit your search text, current location,
                      selected map coordinates, or search-location bias to Google Maps, Google Places,
                      Google Geocoding, or OpenStreetMap Nominatim to provide the feature you requested.
                      Napz does not use location data for advertising or marketing.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div>
                    <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">Permissions and consent</h3>
                    <p>
                      Napz presents an in-app location disclosure and requires an affirmative
                      “Agree &amp; Continue” action before requesting Android location permission.
                      Foreground permission is requested when you use a location feature. A separate
                      background-location disclosure is shown before background permission is requested
                      for an active trip. You may deny or revoke permissions in Android Settings.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div id="napz-account-deletion">

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      If you sign in with Google, Napz may store your name, email address, profile photo,
                      and optional profile fields through Firebase Authentication and Firestore. Saved
                      places and active-trip state are stored on your device until you delete them, stop
                      the trip, clear app data, or uninstall Napz. Napz does not store the continuous
                      trip GPS stream in Firebase.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mt-2">
                      You can request account deletion from the Napz Account screen. This stops active
                      tracking and permanently deletes the Firebase account, Firestore profile and
                      login records controlled by Napz, and local app data. You may also
                      request deletion outside the app by emailing <strong>appointza@gmail.com</strong>
                      with the subject “Napz Account Deletion” and the email address associated with the
                      account. Information may be retained only where required for security, fraud
                      prevention, dispute resolution, or legal obligations.
