Legend: **Public** = no login required. **Auth** = requires login. **Org** = organization/staff area (login + onboarding guard). **User** = signed-in customer area.

### Marketing, auth, and legal (public)

| Screen name | Route(s) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

Redirects: `/profile` → `/user/profile`, `/settings` → `/user/settings`.

**In-app navigation (sidebar / bottom nav):** Dashboard, Appointments, My event bookings (mobile label may be “Events”), Explore, Profile. **Browse events** (`/user/events`) is a valid route but not always a primary nav item.

### Other product surfaces (authenticated)

| Screen name | Route(s) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Momantza booking (embedded)** | `/momantza/booking` | Full-screen wrapper that loads the **Momantza** admin/mobile booking URL in an iframe (URL derived from `organisationdomain` in user context when present). App shell sidebar/bottom nav hidden. |
| **Campusza staff hub** | `/campusza/staff` | Campusza-oriented menu of staff actions (UI entry points; paths shown inside may be placeholders for future routes). Shell nav hidden. |

### Source files vs routes

Page components live under `src/pages/` (and `src/pages/user/`, `src/pages/organization/`, etc.). A few components are **imported in `App.tsx` but have no `<Route>`** (e.g. legacy or inline embeds only): **`BookingPagePreview`**, **`OrganizationTimingSetup`** — use the routed **Timing** (`/organization/timing`) and **Templates** screens unless you add explicit routes.

The page **`ExploreOrganizations`** exists under `src/pages/user/` but is **not** wired to a route; **Explore** uses **`ExploreServices`** at `/explore`.

## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/8b4d0776-a53f-426d-93d2-df2db1af7c49) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

## Global URL Configuration (Web + Android + Server)

Use one command before build instead of searching/replacing URLs manually:

```sh
npm run set:url -- https://your-domain.com
```

This updates:
- UI runtime config files in `public/`
- Android copied runtime config files in `android/app/src/main/assets/www/` (if present)
- Vite env files (`.env`, `.env.development`, `.env.production`)
- Server base URL settings in `PlanItNoww_Server/PlanItNoww/appsettings*.json`

Then build and sync:

```sh
npm run build
npm run cap:sync
```

Build output location:
- Web UI build always goes to `../appointzabuild/production/wwwroot/`

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
- Capacitor (for Android & iOS mobile apps)

## Mobile App Development (Android & iOS)

This project has been configured as a Capacitor app supporting both Android and iOS platforms.

**For iOS:**
- macOS (required for iOS development)
- Xcode installed
- CocoaPods installed (`sudo gem install cocoapods`)

### Development Workflow

1. **Build the web app:**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Sync Capacitor (copies web build to native platforms):**
   ```sh
   npm run cap:sync
   ```

3. **Open in IDE:**
   - **Android:** `npm run cap:open` or `npm run cap:run`
   - **iOS:** `npm run cap:open:ios` or `npm run cap:run:ios`

### Available Capacitor Scripts

- `npm run cap:sync` - Sync web assets to all native platforms
- `npm run cap:copy` - Copy web assets only
- `npm run cap:update` - Update native dependencies
- `npm run cap:open` - Open Android project in Android Studio
- `npm run cap:open:ios` - Open iOS project in Xcode
- `npm run cap:run` - Build, sync, and open Android Studio
- `npm run cap:run:ios` - Build, sync, and open Xcode

### Configuration

- App ID: `com.apppointza`
- App Name: `Appointza`
- Configuration file: `capacitor.config.ts`

After making changes to your web app, remember to rebuild and sync:
```sh
npm run build && npm run cap:sync
```

### Safe Area Support

The app includes full safe area support for both Android and iOS to handle notches, status bars, and system UI elements:

- **Automatic safe area detection** - The app automatically detects and applies safe area insets
- **Status bar integration** - Status bar is configured to work seamlessly with safe areas
- **CSS environment variables** - Safe area insets are available as CSS variables:
  - `--safe-area-inset-top`
  - `--safe-area-inset-bottom`
  - `--safe-area-inset-left`
  - `--safe-area-inset-right`
- **Utility class** - Use `.safe-area-padding` class for components that need safe area padding

The safe area implementation ensures your content is never hidden behind notches, status bars, or navigation bars on modern devices.
